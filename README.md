# AR Air Hockey (Tilt Five) – Unity Project

This is an Augmented Reality Air Hockey game built using **Unity (C#)** and the **Tilt Five AR system**.  
The project focuses on spatial gameplay, responsive interactions, and real-time AR reflections.

##  About the Game
AR Air Hockey recreates classic air hockey in an augmented space.  
Players use a virtual paddle to hit the puck across a real-world table, with AR objects anchored in physical space.

This project demonstrates:
- Spatial anchoring & AR object placement  
- Paddle and puck physics  
- Real-time collision responses  
- Smooth gameplay feel  
- AR interaction using Tilt Five SDK

- Paddle controls & input logic  
- Puck physics, collisions, and scoring  
- Game manager (rounds, scoring, resets)  
- UI and sound integration  
- Scene setup for AR tables  
- Visual effects and polish
